          Come join Atlanta's, human-centered software company. Our team consists of software engineers, people who design for screens, and others who support the thoughtful execution of the former.

        %p Our internship is a 3 month experience. We help early stage professionals overcome the experience dilema via real work experience. Whether you transition up to an apprentice or end up moving onto another gig, it's a great opportunity to get tech experience.

        %p At Polar Notion, we’ve gotten great at two things over the years… delivering remarkable experiences for clients and creating an education-rich environment for aspiring software engineers. While typical employers are looking for people with experience, we’re far from normal. We’re looking to share experiences together and develop your skills through real world projects and mentorship.
